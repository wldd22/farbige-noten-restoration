# Transcriptions

- **OCR transcriptions** are generated using [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) from black and white page scans in `/working/bw-scans`. They are stored in `/transcriptions/ocr` in `.txt` format.
- **Manual transcriptions** are based on the OCR transcriptions and then checked, corrected, and formatted manually by a human to fix errors and remove text from graphics. They are stored in `/transformers/manual` in `.md` format.


## Allowed Markdown

Manual transcriptions are in the `.md` format. For simplicity of parsing and downstream processing, only a selected subset of Markdown features is used. Below is an exhaustive list of all Markdown features permitted for use in the transcriptions:

- Paragraphs*
- *Emphasis* (italic)
- **Strong emphasis** (bold)
- Headings (`#` through `######`)

\*Single line breaks indicate the end of a line, with the following line beginning as a new indented paragraph. Double line breaks indicate an actual gap in the text of the source material, caused by a graphic, a heading, or other element.
